      The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to
      produce a diagnostic report just in case. The diagnostic report (your
      puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded
      properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the
      submarine. The first parameter to check is the power consumption. You need
      to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new
      binary numbers (called the gamma rate and the epsilon rate). The power
      consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon
      rate. Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the most
      common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers in the diagnostic
      report.

      Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma
      rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. What is the power
      consumption of the submarine? (Be sure to represent your answer in
      decimal, not binary.)

      Next, you should verify the life support rating, which can be determined
      by multiplying the oxygen generator rating by the CO2 scrubber rating.
      Both the oxygen generator rating and the CO2 scrubber rating are values
      that can be found in your diagnostic report - finding them is the tricky
      part. Both values are located using a similar process that involves
      filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either
      rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your
      diagnostic report and consider just the first bit of those numbers. Then:
      Keep only numbers selected by the bit criteria for the type of rating
      value for which you are searching. Discard numbers which do not match the
      bit criteria. If you only have one number left, stop; this is the rating
      value for which you are searching. Otherwise, repeat the process,
      considering the next bit to the right. The bit criteria depends on which
      type of rating value you want to find: To find oxygen generator rating,
      determine the most common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and
      keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally
      common, keep values with a 1 in the position being considered. To find CO2
      scrubber rating, determine the least common value (0 or 1) in the current
      bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0
      and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the position being
      considered.

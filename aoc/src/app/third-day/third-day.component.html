      The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to
      produce a diagnostic report just in case. The diagnostic report (your
      puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded
      properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the
      submarine. The first parameter to check is the power consumption. You need
      to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new
      binary numbers (called the gamma rate and the epsilon rate). The power
      consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon
      rate. Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the most
      common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers in the diagnostic
      report.

      <br />
      <br />
      Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma
      rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. What is the power
      consumption of the submarine? (Be sure to represent your answer in
      decimal, not binary.)

      You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm
      goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves
      tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!
      Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for
      situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course
      it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to
      track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; As the
      submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs
      a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep
      report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea
      floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the
      submarine.
      The first order of business is to figure out how quickly the
      depth increases, just so you know what you're dealing with - you never
      know if the keys will get carried into deeper water by an ocean current or
      a fish or something. To do this, count the number of times a depth
      measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no
      measurement before the first measurement.)

      <br />
      <br />
      How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?

      Considering every single measurement isn't as useful as you expected: there's just too much noise in the data.
      Instead, consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window.
      Your goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum.
      
      Consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. How many sums are
      larger than the previous sum?
